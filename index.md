# Seleced projects in Machine Learning(ML), Deep Learning(DL), Reinforcement Learning(RL), and Data Visualization

The projects below demonstrate my knowledge of data processing, model selection, and advanced machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning. Additionally, I have included visual interpretations of a few sample datasets to illustrate my skill range.

## Optimizing Urban Mobility: Feature Engineering Techniques for Machine Learning-Driven Real-Time Traffic Control
This project uses machine learning to address urban traffic congestion by predicting green signals and traffic cycles. It enhances the original dataset through feature engineering, incorporating Level of Service (LOS) Ratings and the Haversine Formula to feature engineer average vehicle speeds, traffic density, and road distances. The Polynomial Regression model showed superior predictive performance compared to others.
