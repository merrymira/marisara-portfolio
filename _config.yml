  Recently graduated in 2024 from the Master of Data Science at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Australia. Before my master's degree, I had 10 years of experience in sales, marketing, and content creation for companies in the retail and education sectors.
  While studying, I was a tutor for Machine Learning at UTS. I am also working on a publication to submit my research to a journal.
